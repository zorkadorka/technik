Multiple files upload is supported by all modern browsers except Internet Explorer. 

= I'm getting the following error: "Fatal error: Call to undefined function get_post_thumbnail_id()". What should I do? =

This error means that your theme doesn't support thumbnail option, in order to add this option please find the file 'functions.php' in your theme and add the following strings to this file:

`add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' );

function theme_setup() {
    add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
}`
