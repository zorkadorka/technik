[Goodbye Admin Bar, Hello ToolBar](//digwp.com/2012/01/goodbye-admin-bar-hello-toolbar/) Posted on: January 13, 2012 by Jeff Starr

When the Admin Bar hit the streets in WordPress 3.1, people seemed to either love it or hate it. And rightly so, it was a significant change in the appearance of the WP Admin area, and if not disabled in your User Profile, the front-end of your site as well. Many tips, tricks and plugins for customizing the Admin Bar began appearing around the Web. And then just as the dust began to settle, BAM — the “Admin Bar” transforms into the “Toolbar” with the WordPress 3.3 update.

The WordPress 3.3 update focused heavily on streamlining and optimizing the Admin experience. The Admin Bar of WP 3.1 was intended as the “first step toward a front-end editor”. The original Admin Bar was debated for several good reasons:

    It’s enabled on the front-end by default
    Gobbles up too much vertical screen space
    It’s redundant, all links available elsewhere
    It’s not visually appealing in general

Using the many Admin Bar tricks that became available around the Web, WordPress users dealt with the thing in their own way and moved on with their lives. Some use plugins, some custom snippets & scripts, some just love it as-is. But now with the new 3.3 update, the big question is “what works and what doesn’t?” We’re glad you asked..
Admin Bar is dead, long live the ToolBar

If you’ve updated to WP 3.3, you’ve seen the smaller “Toolbar” tucked neat above the Admin area. The new Admin Bar ToolBar seems to address some of the main concerns about the old Admin Bar:

    No longer enabled on front-end by default
    Uses less vertical screen space
    Integrates the Admin header area, so no longer redundant
    It looks a little better (in my opinion)

For those who have not yet updated or have no idea what’s going on, here is a visual comparison of the old “Admin Bar” and the new “Toolbar”:

The new ToolBar certainly looks better, but concerns remain. From what I’ve gathered, the main gripe is that the ToolBar is mandatory, and possibly still redundant, depending on site setup and configuration (plugins, networks, etc.). Is it really mandatory? That sounds silly to me, but seems to be the case:

So yeah, something changed, so the question for the Admin ToolBar is “what works and what doesn’t?” Let’s dig in and see what’s up..
Admin Bar changes, now WP ToolBar

As [Ipstenu puts it](//wordpress.org/support/topic/hiding-admin-bar-in-wordpress-33#post-2495448): “You don’t have to like it, but it’s here to stay.” So it’s time to look at things practically and get on with it. First of all, if you have a plugin or functions script that hides, removes, or customizes the Admin Bar, definitely investigate to see if everything is still working according to plan.
What works..

After some testing, we’ve seen the following functions.php snippets continue to work in WordPress version 3.3:

// disable the admin bar (front end only) -> show_admin_bar( false );
// disable the admin bar (front end only) -> add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' );

In WP 3.1, these functions hid the Admin Bar on both sides of the fence — front end & back end. In WP 3.3+, these snippets will hide the Admin ToolBar only on the front-end of your site (the public side). Likewise, this snippet of CSS added to your theme’s style.css file hides the ToolBar on the front-end:

/* hide the admin bar (front end only) */ -> #wpadminbar{display:none}

Keep in mind that, when using the CSS method, the ToolBar markup is still present in the source code, but will not be displayed in the browser.

Here is another useful snippet for disabling the ToolBar for lesser users:

// show admin bar only for admins -> if ( !current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) { add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' ); }
// show admin bar only for admins and editors -> if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_posts' ) ) { add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' ); }

Note that this also only applies to ToolBar display on the front-end.
What doesn’t work..

Basically the show_admin_bar() function seems to work as it did before version 3.3, except that now the ToolBar is integral to the Admin area, so disabling it using the previous functions works only on the front-end of your site. So tricks like this stopped working:

If you’re running WP 3.1+ or 3.2+ (not 3.3+), then show_admin_bar() will continue to disable the Admin Bar on both front and back ends of WordPress.

To be continued..

Without a doubt things will continue to change, and it’ll be fun watching as WordPress continues to evolve, ToolBar and all :)

2. "New" ToolBar: smaller, simpler, but redundant ...
3. "Old" Admin Bar Personal Options: full control ...

5. Admin Bar and ToolBar with "One Click Logout Barless" add-on Plugin ...
6. DashBoard with "WP ToolBar Removal": faster and user friendly ...
7. Personal Options: not needed if Admin Bar or ToolBar is disadled and removed!

`sLa NGjI's Team do not provide support on wordpress.org forum!`

Dear user of plugins or themes:

`sLa NGjI’s Team has started adventure on
wordpress.org forum since 2007: 7 years ago!`

Everything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.

The traffic generated by users of the wordpress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.

In the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.

By contrast, both the posts and threads definable "requests" and those definable "trash" are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.

With the passage of time, the problems of this type of assistance have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered insufficient or inadequate to many of them.

Many of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing other methods of customer care.

Our team has tried to respond to all for seven long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean, neat, and clear.

Failing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, through the instruments of wordpress.org forum, as of today August 15, 2014 we abandon the active support with this type of structure, started since August 7, 2007 to try to give one type of service more personalized, and targeted, to requests of users.

* Please note that:
 * We are not interested in reviews on our plugins and themes.
 * Do not write anything like that!
 * We are not interested in stars on our plugins and themes.
 * Do not make any in that sections!

Generally we're not interested to be informed if you like our plugins and themes, or if you use them successfully through the instruments of the wordpress.org forums!

Remember to keep proper behavior on the wordpress.org forum, under the rules, respect all their moderators, and its users: this team do not supporting anymore wordpress.org forum, and the possibility that some of us then reply or write on wordpress.org forum, will be very low!
